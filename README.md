# Food Recipe Web-scraper
This project was created to develop a solution to this constant problem:
You have certain ingredients available in your pantry, but you're unsure as to what you can make.

The food recipe web-scraper (currently) takes in a single ingredient and returns the top 20 recipes from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
It's still a work-in-progress, but will eventually pull data from various recipe websites, such as the [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/)

Documentation is not yet fully completed.
